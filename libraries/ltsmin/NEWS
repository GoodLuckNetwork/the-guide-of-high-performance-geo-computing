March 31, 2009 - Release 1.2 of the LTSmin toolset.

The main improvements in this release are:
 * Option parsing is now performed using the popt library. Thus, all
   long options now start with a double minus.
 * The user can choose between BuDDy and ATermDD as the decision diagram
   library used in the symbolic tools.
 * A new compressed file format for labeled transition systems with
   arbitrary numbers of state and edge labels has been implemented.
 * The symbolic tools can write the results of the reachability analysis
   in the form of an ETF (Enumerated Table Format) file. This ETF file
   can be used as input for the reachabilty tools and can be directly
   translated to DVE.
