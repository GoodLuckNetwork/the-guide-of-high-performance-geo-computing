== NAME

ltsmin-convert - convert file formats for labelled transition system 

== SYNOPSIS

*ltsmin-convert* [OPTION]... 'input' 'output'

== DESCRIPTION

This tool copies 'input' to 'output' and changes the archive format
on-the-fly.  Both input and output format are detected by pattern
matching. See the File Formats section for details.

== OPTIONS

*--segments*::
Set the number of segments in the output file.  If the output format
does not support segmentation (BCG) then the default is 1 and
specifying any number other than 1 is an error.  Otherwise, the
default is the same number of segments as the input.  Please note that
the algorithm used for changing the number of segments is simple.  It
guarantees that the number of states in the output is balanced, but
not much more.  E.g., if the input is in BFS order and just one
segment then then the output will still be in BFS order.  However, if
the input has more than one segment then BFS order is lost.
