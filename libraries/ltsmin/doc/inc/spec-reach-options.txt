        Select the exploration strategy: 'bfs', 'bfs2' or 'chain'.
        With 'bfs', breadth-first search is used.  With 'bfs2', the
        visited set is always extends the visited set.  With 'chain',
        a chaining strategy to explore.  Defaults to 'chain'.

When using BFS, the tool performs the next state computation for all
edge groups on the current level or current set of visited states.
Chaining means to apply next state for the first group to the visited
states, then apply next-state for the second group to the result,
etc..  Thus, a chaining analysis can be completed in much less
iterations than a BFS analysis.
