=== Vector Set Options

*--vset*='TYPE'::
        Select type of vector set: 'list', 'tree' or 'fdd'.  With
        'list', ATermDD with list encoding are used.  With 'tree',
        ATermDD with tree encoding are used.  With 'fdd', BuDDy FDDs
        are used.  Defaults to 'list'. Note that the tree version of
        ATermDD is a partial implementation and therefore not available
        in the symbolic reachability tools.
