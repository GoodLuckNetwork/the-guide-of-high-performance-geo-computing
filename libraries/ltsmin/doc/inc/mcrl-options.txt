        Make the state parameters visible.

*--mcrl*='OPTIONS'::
        Pass options to the linkman:mcrl[1] library.
        Defaults to "+-alt rw+".

Allowed values depend on the linkman:mcrl[1] library.
//Commonly, the following are provided: +rw+, +rww+, +jitty+.

NOTE: Some option combinations can lead to incorrect results, e.g.,
tau confluence when caching is enabled. Therefore, the use of tau confluence
has been disabled, but there may be other combinations.
